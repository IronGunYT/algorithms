# Algorithms

<hr>

Repository with my versions of popular algorithms

Inspired by [TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus)

## Overview
The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in C++. The algorithms are divided into different categories.
Each category has its own CMakeLists.txt file, which is used to build the corresponding category. The CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory is used to build all categories.
